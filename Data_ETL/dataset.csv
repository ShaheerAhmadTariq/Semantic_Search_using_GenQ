With the landscape as a backdrop, the interiors of Bali open to the horizon of the coast of Malaga to incorporate it into each space. In addition, its large terraces will allow you to enjoy your home during any season of the year.

Bali occupies a privileged position on a promontory overlooking an extensive natural landscape. The Sierra Bermeja mountain range provides an extraordinary mountain scenery, while the outline of the Bay of Malaga provides a perfect Mediterranean panorama.

Swimming in the Bali pool is like floating over the horizon. Located on the hillside that crowns the development, its views extend unobstructed, both inland and towards the coast. 

To make the most of its extraordinary location, the architects Maíz y Díaz, were taken on. They occupy a prestigious Malaga studio and offer great experience and extensive knowledge of the terrain. Their approach has been as simple as it is effective; to arrange the buildings in a linear way on the viewpoint of La Zenaida, where the buildings and their wide terraces emerge as strata of the mountain itself.

Rincón de la Victoria remains outside the hustle and bustle of the Costa del Sol, but close to everything you need. A location of great scenic value that combines the best of the sea and the mountains just 20 minutes from the centre of Malaga and 30 minutes from the international airport.

As in all of the Costa del Sol, Rincón de la Victoria also has a golf course nearby, Añoreta, with 18 holes and sea views.

In Bali you have beaches to choose from, Rincón de la Victoria, Bengalbón, Benajarafe, Cala del Moral... The best thing to do is to try them all.

If you are tired of the beach, we recommend that you visit the reservoir of La Viñuela, ideal for canoeing and swimming in its turquoise waters

Thanks to its privileged access to the A-7, Bali is less than 20 minutes from Malaga International Airport. 

The layout of the buildings follows the crest of a natural promontory, maintaining the original forms of its orography and arranging itself before the landscape as a habitable promontory whose views are unsurpassed.",,,,,
